# Deploy

In this document, you will learn how to deploy your JavaScript-based web application using the Vercel CLI or
GitHub Actions.

## Using the Vercel CLI

Vercel provides a CLI that helps us deploy the application using the terminal with a simple series of steps.
Don't worry about the length or complexity of the files.

### Install Vercel as a global dependency

Use the following command to install Vercel globally using npm or pnpm package managers:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Code lang="bash">
\# npm
npm install -g vercel@latest
\# pnpm
pnpm install -g vercel@latest
</Code>

### Login

Log in to your Vercel account using either Google, GitHub, or Email.

<Code lang="bash">vercel login</Code>

### Link Your Project

Link your local project with your remote projects on Vercel that exist in your account. Follow these steps
to link the project:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Code lang="bash">
vercel link
 ? Set up "~\path" ?
 ? Which scope should contain your project ?
 ? Link to existing project ?
 ? What's your project's name ?
</Code>

### Pull Configuration From Vercel Online

It is recommended to run the <Mark>vercel pull</Mark> command before the <Mark>vercel build</Mark> command
to retrieve the environment variables from the remote project.

### Build Your Project

Build your local project. Follow the next step:

<Code lang="bash">vercel build --target=production</Code>

This command builds your project locally or in your CI environment. The build artifacts are placed by default
into the <Mark>./vercel/output</Mark> directory. You can see the files generated in the build process
and check if they were created correctly. If there are any errors or issues, you can fix them and re-run the command.

You can also specify different environments using the <Mark>--target</Mark> flag, such as:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Code lang="bash">
vercel build --target=production
\# or
vercel build --target=staging
</Code>

### Unstable

Although the Vercel CLI is powerful and simple, it is not yet fully stable. In multiple operations and processes,
it may not work as expected or return unexpected values. However, it is a great tool that can enhance productivity
over time.

## GitHub Actions

Using Vercel with GitHub Actions is a powerful and advanced use case for automating processes like

<Mark>Preview Deployments</Mark>, <Mark>Development Deployments</Mark>, and <Mark>Production Deployments</Mark>. These actions are
triggered by events in your repository, such as push, pull_request, or release.

This approach allows you to customize and have better control over the CI/CD pipeline of your project. If you want
a basic and controlled access to the resources to be deployed, use <Mark>vercel build</Mark>.

### Preview Deployment

A <Mark>Preview Deployment</Mark> is created every time users push a commit to a remote branch. This deployment is
useful for checking the state of the changes made in the commit, such as the latest UI changes or verifying if the
build process was successful.

<Code lang="bash" children={deploy.preview} />

### Production Deployment

A <Mark>Production Deployment</Mark> is created when a commit is made to the main branch (by default, master or main).
This environment is frequently used after merging a pull request.

<Code lang="bash" children={deploy.production} />

### Setup Workflows

To deploy the application to any environment you have set up for the project using the CLI or the online project
configuration, you need to configure the <Mark>VERCEL_ORG_ID</Mark> and <Mark>VERCEL_PROJECT_ID</Mark> variables.
Follow these steps to obtain and use them:

1. Generate the [Access Token](https://vercel.com/guides/how-do-i-use-a-vercel-api-access-token).
2. Install the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli).
3. Log in to your Vercel account by running <Mark>vercel login</Mark>.
4. Link your project by running <Mark>vercel link</Mark>.
5. Pull environment variables from the remote project by running <Mark>vercel pull</Mark>.
6. Inside the generated <Mark>.vercel</Mark> folder, locate the <Mark>project.json</Mark> file, which contains the
   <Mark>projectId</Mark> and <Mark>orgId</Mark> fields.
7. Go to your GitHub repository and open the <Mark>Settings</Mark>.
8. Navigate to <Mark>Secrets and variables</Mark> and click on <Mark>Actions</Mark>.
9. Create three <Mark>Repository secrets</Mark> named:
   - <Mark>VERCEL_TOKEN</Mark>
   - <Mark>VERCEL_ORG_ID</Mark>
   - <Mark>VERCEL_PROJECT_ID</Mark>
