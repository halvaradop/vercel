# Deploy

In this document, you will learn how to deploy your JavaScript-based web application using Vercel CLI or GitHub Actions.

## Using the Vercel CLI

Vercel provides a CLI that helps us deploy the application using the terminal with a simple series of steps. Don't worry about the length or complexity of the files.

### Install Vercel as a global dependency

Use the following command to install Vercel globally using npm or pnpm package managers:

<Code
    lang="bash"
    code={`
npm i -g vercel@latest
# or
pnpm add -g vercel@latest   
    `}
/>

### Link Your Project

Link your local project with your remote projects on Vercel that exist in your account. Follow these steps to link the project:

<Code
    lang="bash"
    code={`
vercel link
 ? Set up "~\path" ?
 ? Which scope should contain your project ?
 ? Link to existing project ?
 ? What's your project's name ?
  `}
/>

### Build Your Project

Build your local project. Follow the next step:

<Code
    lang="bash"
    code={`
vercel build
    `}
/>
